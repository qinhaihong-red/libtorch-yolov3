## bugs fixed for:
- !is_variable() ASSERT FAILED at ../c10/core/TensorImpl.h:922

in _Darknet.cpp_.  


__Noet:I use the libtorch by compiling from the latest source,while some errs occur with the original libtorch_yolov3 during compiling and runtime.So I do little fixes.__

About the err above,you can see more details here:https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/manually-set-variable-data-in-c/41553
